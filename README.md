What is Academica RMS
#######################

Academica RMS is a multiuser result management system built to enable schools
(High Schools and colleges) handle the tedious task of result compilation and 
record keeping. It is part of the goal to digitalize Africa and make data 
collection and storage even more faster and better. Academica RMS is a work in
progress as more updates will be released and many other features that are lacking
are completely delivered.
